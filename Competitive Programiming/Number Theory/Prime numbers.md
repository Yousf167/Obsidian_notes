# Prime Numbers
### 🔢 **What is a Prime Number?**

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that **has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself**.

Examples:
- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19...
- **2 is the only even prime** number.
If a number isn’t prime, it’s called **composite** (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...).

### 🧱 **Basic Properties of Prime Numbers**

1. **Infinitude**: There are infinitely many primes. Proven by Euclid around 300 BC.
2. **1 is not prime**: By modern definition, 1 is not considered a prime number.
3. **All even numbers except 2 are not prime**.
4. If a number $n$ is not divisible by any prime ≤ $\sqrt{n}$, then $n$ is prime.

### 🧮 **Prime Factorization**
- Every integer >1> 1 can be written uniquely as a **product of prime numbers**.
- This is called the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**.

Example:  
$60=22×3×560 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5$

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Twin Primes**           | Pairs like (3, 5), (11, 13), (17, 19)... Difference = 2          |
| **Mersenne Primes**       | Of the form $2^p - 1$, where $p$ is prime                        |
| **Fermat Primes**         | Of the form $2^p + 1$                                            |
| **Sophie Germain Primes** | A prime $p$ where $2p + 1$ is also prime                         |
| **Prime Gaps**            | The differences between successive primes                        |
| **Goldbach's Conjecture** | Every even number > 2 is the sum of two primes (still unproven!) |

### 🧪 **How to Check if a Number is Prime**

1. **Trial Division**: Check divisibility up to $\sqrt{n}$.
2. **[[Sieve of Eratosthenes]]**: Efficient for finding all primes up to a certain number.
3. **Primality Tests**:
	- **Fermat’s Little Theorem**
	- **Miller-Rabin Test** (probabilistic)
	- **AKS Primality Test** (deterministic, polynomial-time)

### 🔐 **Primes in Real Life**

- **Cryptography**: RSA encryption is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into primes.
- **Random number generation**
- **Hashing algorithms**
- Used in **error detection**, **signal processing**, and even **art**!

### 🧠 Fun Prime Facts
- **Largest known prime** (as of 2024):  $2^{82,589,933} - 1$, which has over 24 million digits 😳
- Discovered using **distributed computing** (GIMPS project).
- **Prime constellations**: patterns of primes spaced apart in a regular way.
- Primes appear **random**, but have deep underlying patterns we're still exploring.
