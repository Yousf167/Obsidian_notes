# Number Theory
Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that deals with the **properties and relationships of numbers**, especially the **integers** (like -3, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.).

It focuses on things like:
- **[[Prime numbers]]** (numbers only divisible by 1 and themselves, like 2, 3, 5, 7...)
- **[[Divisibility]]** (like how 6 is divisible by 3)
- **Greatest common divisors ([[GCD]])** and **least common multiples ([[LCM]])**
- **[[Modular arithmetic]]** (which is like clock math, used a lot in cryptography)
- **[[Diophantine equations]]** (equations where we look for integer solutions, like x2+y2=z2x^2 + y^2 = z^2)
- **[[Perfect numbers]]**, **[[Fibonacci numbers]]**, etc.
It’s called the **"Queen of Mathematics"** because it's very deep and beautiful — and surprisingly useful, especially in **cryptography**, **computer science**, and **coding theory**.
