| **Aspect**             | **Class Diagram**                                                                                | **Use Case Diagram**                                                                | **Sequence Diagram**                                                            | **Activity Diagram**                                                                           |

| **Purpose**            | Models the static structure of a system, focusing on classes and their relationships.            | Represents the functionality of a system from a user's perspective.                 | Models interactions between objects in a time-ordered sequence.                 | Represents workflows, processes, or operations within a system.                                |
| **Focus**              | Structure: Attributes, methods, and relationships between classes.                               | Functionality: How actors interact with the system.                                 | Interaction: Communication between objects over time.                           | Flow: Sequence and conditions of activities or processes.                                      |
| **Key Elements**       | Classes, attributes, methods, associations, inheritance, aggregation, composition.               | Actors, use cases, system boundary, relationships (e.g., include, extend).          | Objects, lifelines, messages, activation bars, loops, conditions.               | Activities, transitions, decisions, forks, joins, swimlanes.                                   |
| **Scope**              | Defines what a system **is**.                                                                    | Defines what a system **does**.                                                     | Defines **how** a system **works** (interaction between objects).               | Defines **how** a system **flows** (step-by-step process).                                     |
| **Static/Dynamic**     | Static (unchanging relationships).                                                               | Static (high-level functionality).                                                  | Dynamic (interaction over time).                                                | Dynamic (sequence of actions and decisions).                                                   |
| **Time Consideration** | No time aspect; relationships are permanent.                                                     | No time aspect; focuses on functionality.                                           | Time-dependent (chronological order of messages).                               | Time-independent; focuses on the order of actions.                                             |
| **Parallelism**        | Not applicable.                                                                                  | Not applicable.                                                                     | Limited (loops/conditions).                                                     | Supports parallel flows using forks and joins.                                                 |
| **Best For**           | - Modeling database or object-oriented design. - Showing relationships and structure of classes. | - Understanding system requirements. - Analyzing user interactions with the system. | - Understanding specific use case functionality. - Showing object interactions. | - Modeling workflows or business processes. - Representing conditional and parallel processes. |
| **Visualization**      | Structural blueprint of the system.                                                              | High-level interaction between users and the system.                                | Detailed, precise flow of object communication.                                 | Broad, abstract representation of processes and flows.                                         |

### **Summary**

- **Class Diagrams** are about **what the system is made of** (structure).
- **Use Case Diagrams** are about **what the system does** (functionality).
- **Sequence Diagrams** are about **how the system works** (object interactions).
- **Activity Diagrams** are about **how processes flow** (workflow).
