## Software engineering:
A discipline that aim to produce fault-free software, delivered on time, within budget and satisfies the user’s needs. Furthermore, the software must be easy to
modify when the user’s need change.
#### OR

Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is
concerned with all aspects of software production.

## What does a Software Engineer do?
Studies the _Problems_ and _Requirements_ of an organization to determine how people, methods, and computer technology can best accomplish improvements for the business.

---
## Role of Software Engineer

* Facilitate communication between all groups with a stake in the project.
* Elicit requirements from as many sources as possible 
* Document requirements in an accurate and consistent manner, ensuring as many good properties as possible.
* Manage future revisions of requirements (version control) to meet evolving needs of system.

---
## Stakeholders
Who has an interest in the final system and therefore, an influence on requirements?

## Characteristics of Good SE 
### 1. Impertinence:
* Question everything, assume nothing
### 2. impartiality
* find the best solution to the business problem
### 3. Relax constraints:
* assume anything is possible and eliminate the infeasible 
### 4. Attention to detail:
* be precise, comprehensive, consistent
### 3. Re-framing:
* be creative, ‘think outside the square’

## Models, Techniques And Tools
### Models:
A representation of some important aspect of the real world
Models used in system development include representations of inputs, outputs,
processes, data, objects, object interactions, locations, networks, and devices etc.
	• Graphical
	• Mathematical
	• Physical
### Techniques
a collection of guidelines that help the analyst complete a system
development activity or task
	• Data modeling techniques
	• Software testing techniques
### Tools
Supportive software that helps create models or other components
required in the project
	• Computer-aided system engineering (CASE) tools
	• Integrated development environment (IDE)

## Essential Elements for Successful Software Development
* The Software is for the End-User
* Establish Phases and Tasks
* Software Development is Not a Sequential Process
* Software are Capital Investments
* Don’t Be Afraid to Cancel
* Documentation is a Product of All Phases
* Problem-Solving Skills

## What counts as a project failure? 
* Complete failure implies no deliverable output.
* Other types of failure include:
* Cost overruns
* Software quality problems
* Missed deadlines
* Unsatisfied stakeholders:
* Operational failure
