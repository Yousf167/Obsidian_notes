Maven is a build tool that helps programmers manage their projects and and all the things they need to build their programs. maven helps by fetching dependencies, building, and testing the program 

```
mvnw [options] [<goal(s)>] [<phase(s)>]
```

## ./mvnw [options]
1. clean: remove temp dirs and files
2. default: most useful goals
3. site: generate docs

## ./mvnw clean
1. pre-clean: 
2. clean
3. post-clean
```
./mvnw clean: cleans the project
```
In Maven, the terms **pre-clean** and **post-clean** refer to specific phases of the Maven build lifecycle, particularly in the **clean** lifecycle.

- **pre-clean**: This phase is executed **before** the `clean` phase. It is typically used to perform tasks or preparations required before cleaning up the project (e.g., taking backups or stopping services).
    
- **clean**: The `clean` phase is responsible for removing all files generated by the previous build (e.g., deleting the `target/` directory in a typical Maven project).
    
- **post-clean**: This phase is executed **after** the `clean` phase. It is commonly used for finalizing or cleaning up additional artifacts or resources after the main cleanup process.
    

### Usage

To execute these phases in a project, you don't call them directly. Instead, you can bind specific tasks to these phases in the `pom.xml` file using plugins.

### Example in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-clean-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.2.0</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>backup-before-clean</id>
                        <phase>pre-clean</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>some-goal</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <!-- Configuration for the goal -->
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                    <execution>
                        <id>cleanup-after-clean</id>
                        <phase>post-clean</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>some-other-goal</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <!-- Configuration for the goal -->
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

### Using `mvnw`

If you're using the Maven wrapper (`mvnw`), you can execute the `clean` lifecycle phases as follows:

1. Run the **clean** lifecycle:
    
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean
    ```
    
    This triggers the `pre-clean`, `clean`, and `post-clean` phases in that order.
    
2. To trigger a specific plugin goal bound to one of these phases:
    
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean -Pprofile-name
    ```
    

If you want to do something custom for `pre-clean` or `post-clean`, make sure you've defined it in your `pom.xml`.

## ./mvnw [default]
1. compile: compiles into bytecode
2. test: runs unit tests
3. package: creates a jar or war file
4. verify: runs checks and integration tests

```
EX: ./mvnw compile
```

Note: to run the app through the terminal:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
to stop:
```
Ctrl + C
```
